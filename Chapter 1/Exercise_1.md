Objectives of the program:

* Convert inches to centimeters when entering any value in inches;

Program design: 

1) User interface is consol or terminal (for Linux);

2) Program organization:

    * Infinite request to enter a value in inches (until you enter, 
        for example, a letter that is a non-numeric value);

    * Output appropriate value;

3) Development time: about 5-7 minutes;

4) Representation of data in the form of a set of real numbers, 
since 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters (here there is a fractional part).
